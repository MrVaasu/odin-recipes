    <h3><span>How to make Pierogi (Polish Dumplings)</span></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong> Make potato filling:</strong> Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Make dough:</strong> Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Knead dough</strong> on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Divide dough in half</strong>, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Moisten edges with water, <strong>fold over</strong>, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a <strong>boil</strong>. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
